# AUTO-ARMOUR-CHECKER - PLUGIN DESCRIPTION- by TacticalAxis  
Welcome to the configuration file of the Auto-Armour Checker plugin. The aim is to help servers with the problem of players using hacked clients on their server. This plugin specifically helps players who use the Auto-Armour hack. This hack allows them to automatically put on armour, without having to click on the armour. This plugin helps in such a way, that if you see someone automatically put armour on you can just type in the command and it will take off all their armour and put it back into their inventory. You can tell that they are using this hack if the armour appears on them automatically. If their inventory is full, then their armour is automatically dropped onto the ground. Thanks for downloading this plugin. Your support is really appreciated. I hope you enjoy the plugin! Please leave a review on the plugin page to support me!
